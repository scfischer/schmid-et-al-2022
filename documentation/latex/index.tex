The human respiratory system can be functionally separated into a conducting zone and a respiratory zone. The latter is characterized by alveoli, tissue structures that enable close proximity of inhaled air to deoxygenated blood coming from the heart resulting in gas exchange. The uptake of oxygen is divided into two processes\+: the diffusion of oxygen molecules from inhaled air through the thin tissue barrier into the blood plasma and the red blood cells and then their binding to hemoglobin molecules. These events are influenced by a variety of factors and other processes.

The objective of this project is to visualize the lung tissue at the scale of an alveolus and simulate gas exchange. We start by considering the most substantial influences on diffusion\+: Partial pressures of the respective gases, morphometric properties of the diffusion barrier and blood volume and velocity. The goal is to convey an understanding of the tight relation between structure and function and how different conditions and processes can affect gas exchange.
