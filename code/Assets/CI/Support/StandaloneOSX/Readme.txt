# Starting Alveolus

As this is an in-development prototype, the application is not yet signed.
Therefore, a warning dialog might appear upon executing this application.

Please note that this is currently expected behavior.
None the less, only trust any application if you trust the source.

1. To open the application, please use the context menu (right-click / two-finger click) and select "Open".
2. A warning dialog will show. If it does not provide an "Open" option, dismiss the dialog, and repeat step 1.
3. The dialog will then provide the option "Open".
